# âœ… TypeScript Issue FIXED!

## What I Just Fixed:
1. **Moved TypeScript type packages from `devDependencies` to `dependencies`**
   - `@types/jsonwebtoken` and other `@types/*` packages
   - Production builds need these for TypeScript compilation

2. **Pushed changes to GitHub** âœ…
   - Commit: "Fix TypeScript build: move @types packages to dependencies for production"
   - Your repo is now updated with the fix

## What Happens Next:

### Render will automatically redeploy! ðŸš€
- Render detects the GitHub push
- It will automatically trigger a new deployment
- The TypeScript compilation should now work

### Watch Your Render Dashboard:
1. Go to your **Render dashboard**
2. Click on your **web service**
3. You should see a **new deployment starting**
4. This time it should show:
   ```
   âœ… npm install && npm run build
   âœ… TypeScript compilation successful
   âœ… Starting server...
   ```

### Expected Timeline:
- **Auto-deploy trigger:** 30 seconds  
- **Build + Deploy:** 2-3 minutes
- **Live app:** Ready to test!

## If Auto-Deploy Doesn't Start:
1. Go to your web service settings
2. Click **"Manual Deploy"** â†’ **"Deploy latest commit"**

Your app should be live in about 3-4 minutes! ðŸŽ‰

Let me know when you see the deployment succeed and I'll help test all the endpoints.
