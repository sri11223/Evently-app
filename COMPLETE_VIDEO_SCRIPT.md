## **PART 2: MY APPROACH & ARCHITECTURE (3 minutes)**

### **Solution Overview (45 seconds)**
*"I designed a microservices-inspired backend using Node.js and TypeScript, with a multi-layered architecture that separates concerns and ensures scalability."*

**Show Architecture Diagram:**
*"Here's my high-level architecture:*
- *API Gateway layer for routing and authentication*

- *Data access layer with repository patterns*
- *Caching layer using Redis*
- *Database layer with PostgreSQL and sharding support*
- *Background processing for notifications and cleanup"*

### **Database Design & ER Diagram (90 seconds)**
**Show ER Diagram:**
*"The database design focuses on data integrity and performance:*

**Core Entities:**
- *Users table with role-based access (admin/user)*

- *Bookings table with unique references and status tracking*
- *Waitlist table for overflow management*

**Key Relationships:**
- *One-to-many: Users to Bookings*
- *One-to-many: Events to Bookings*
- *Many-to-many: Users to Events (through Bookings)*
- *Constraint checks ensure available_seats <= total_capacity*

**Advanced Features:**
- *UUID primary keys for distributed systems*

- *Composite indexes for query optimization*
- *Foreign key constraints for referential integrity"*

### **Technical Architecture Deep Dive (45 seconds)**
*"The system uses several advanced techniques:*

**Concurrency Control:**
- *Optimistic locking with version columns*
- *Database transactions for atomic operations*
- *Row-level locking for critical sections*

**Scalability:**
- *Redis caching with TTL strategies*
- *Database connection pooling*
- *Horizontal sharding support*
- *Background job processing*

**Design Patterns:**
- *Repository pattern for data access*
- *Service layer for business logic*
- *Middleware pattern for authentication*
- *Observer pattern for notifications"*

## **PART 3: DATABASE SCHEMA & TECHNIQUES (1.5 minutes)**

### **Schema Walkthrough (60 seconds)**
**Show schema.sql file:**
*"Let me walk through the database schema:*

**Users Table:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    role VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'user',
    version INTEGER DEFAULT 1  -- For optimistic locking
);
```

**Events Table with Concurrency Control:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE events (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    total_capacity INTEGER NOT NULL,
    available_seats INTEGER NOT NULL,
    version INTEGER DEFAULT 1,  -- Critical for race conditions
    CONSTRAINT check_capacity CHECK (available_seats <= total_capacity)
);
```

**Bookings with Business Logic:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE bookings (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    event_id UUID REFERENCES events(id),
    quantity INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (quantity > 0),
    booking_reference VARCHAR(20) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'confirmed'
);
```

### **Advanced Techniques (30 seconds)**
*"Key techniques implemented:*
- *Optimistic locking prevents race conditions*
- *Database triggers auto-generate booking references*
- *Composite indexes optimize complex queries*
- *Check constraints ensure data integrity*
- *Foreign keys maintain referential integrity"*

## **PART 4: LIVE SYSTEM DEMO (4 minutes)**

### **System Health & Status (30 seconds)**
**Open browser/Postman:**
```
GET https://evently-app-7hx2.onrender.com/health
```
*"First, let's verify the system is running. As you can see, the server is operational with database connections established."*

```
GET https://evently-app-7hx2.onrender.com/api/v1/database/status
```
*"The database status shows all 4 tables created with sample data loaded - 3 events and multiple users ready for testing."*

### **Authentication System (60 seconds)**
**User Registration:**
```
POST https://evently-app-7hx2.onrender.com/api/v1/auth/register
{
  "name": "Demo User",
  "email": "demo@evently.com",
  "password": "demo123",
  "role": "user"
}
```
