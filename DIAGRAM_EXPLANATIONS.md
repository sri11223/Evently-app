# üé¨ ARCHITECTURE & ER DIAGRAM EXPLANATIONS

## üèóÔ∏è **ARCHITECTURE DIAGRAM EXPLANATION**

### **"Let me walk you through the complete system architecture of Evently..."**

---

### **1. CLIENT TIER (Top Layer)**
*"At the top, we have the client tier which includes web applications, mobile apps, admin dashboards, and third-party API consumers. All communication happens over HTTPS for security and WebSocket for real-time features."*

### **2. GATEWAY LAYER (Entry Point)**
*"The gateway layer is our first line of defense and traffic management:*
- **Load Balancer**: *Distributes incoming requests across multiple server instances*
- **Rate Limiter**: *Prevents abuse with multi-tier rate limiting per user and IP*
- **API Gateway**: *Routes requests and handles authentication*
- **Request Tracing**: *Tracks every request for debugging and monitoring*
- **Security**: *CORS and CSRF protection for web security*
- **Health Monitoring**: *Continuous system health checks*

*This layer ensures our system can handle thousands of concurrent users safely."*

### **3. APPLICATION TIER (Core Processing)**
*"The application tier runs on Node.js with TypeScript:*
- **Node.js Cluster**: *Multiple process instances for high availability*
- **Express.js Framework**: *Fast, lightweight web framework*
- **TypeScript**: *Type safety and better maintainability*

**Core Controllers handle specific business functions:**
- **Event Controller**: *Manages event CRUD operations*  
- **Booking Controller**: *Handles ticket booking and cancellation*
- **Waitlist Controller**: *Manages overflow users when events are full*
- **Analytics Controller**: *Provides real-time insights and reports*
- **Pricing Controller**: *Dynamic pricing based on demand*

**Additional Services:**
- **WebSocket Server**: *Real-time notifications and live updates*
- **Background Job Queue**: *Handles email sending, reminders, and async processing*"*

### **4. BUSINESS LOGIC TIER (Smart Processing)**
*"This is where the magic happens - all our business rules and algorithms:*
- **Service Layer Pattern**: *Encapsulates complex business logic*
- **Concurrency Control**: *Prevents race conditions during high-traffic booking*
- **Validation Engine**: *Ensures data integrity and business rules*
- **Transaction Management**: *ACID compliance for critical operations*
- **Event Processing**: *Handles complex event workflows*"*

### **5. CACHING LAYER (Performance Optimization)**
*"Redis caching provides lightning-fast performance:*
- **Event Cache**: *Frequently accessed event data (5-minute TTL)*
- **User Session Cache**: *JWT tokens and user profiles (24-hour TTL)*
- **Analytics Cache**: *Dashboard data and reports (1-hour TTL)*
- **Booking Cache**: *Recent bookings and user history (2-minute TTL)*
- **Capacity Cache**: *Real-time seat availability (30-second TTL)*
- **Rate Limit Cache**: *API usage tracking and throttling*

*This reduces database load by 80% and provides sub-100ms response times."*

### **6. DATABASE LAYER (Data Foundation)**
*"PostgreSQL with advanced features:*
- **Master Database**: *Handles all write operations with ACID transactions*
- **Read Replicas**: *Load balances read queries and analytics*
- **Database Sharding**: *Horizontal scaling across multiple shards*
- **Connection Pooling**: *Efficient database resource management*

*The database is designed to handle millions of records with optimized indexes."*

### **7. BACKGROUND PROCESSING (Async Operations)**
*"Critical background tasks:*
- **Job Queue**: *Email sending, notifications, and report generation*
- **Event Scheduler**: *Automated reminders and waitlist processing*
- **Cleanup Workers**: *Expired bookings, cache cleanup, and maintenance*

*This ensures the main API remains fast by handling heavy operations asynchronously."*

## üìä **ER DIAGRAM EXPLANATION**

### **"Now let's dive into the database design and entity relationships..."**

---

### **1. USERS TABLE (Central Entity)**
*"Users are the heart of our system:*
- **UUID Primary Key**: *Enables distributed systems and sharding*
- **Unique Email**: *Authentication and contact*
- **Role Enum**: *Admin and regular user permissions*
- **Version Column**: *Optimistic locking for concurrency*
- **Timestamps**: *Audit trail and analytics*

*This table supports both regular users booking events and admins managing the platform."*

### **2. EVENTS TABLE (Core Business Entity)**
*"Events represent the bookable experiences:*
- **Capacity Management**: *Total capacity and available seats tracking*
- **Business Constraints**: *Check constraints ensure available_seats ‚â§ total_capacity*
- **Pricing**: *Decimal precision for financial accuracy*
- **Status Enum**: *Active, cancelled, completed states*
- **Version Control**: *Critical for preventing overbooking during concurrent access*
- **Created By**: *Links to admin user who created the event*

*This design prevents the billion-dollar problem of overselling tickets."*

### **3. BOOKINGS TABLE (Transaction Entity)**
*"Bookings represent confirmed ticket purchases:*
- **Foreign Keys**: *Links to both user and event*
- **Quantity**: *Number of tickets booked*
- **Total Amount**: *Financial tracking with decimal precision*
- **Booking Reference**: *Unique identifier for customer service*
- **Status Tracking**: *Confirmed, cancelled, refunded states*
- **Version Control**: *Prevents double-booking scenarios*

*Auto-generated triggers create unique booking references like 'EVT20250914123456'."*

### **4. WAITLIST TABLE (Overflow Management)**
*"When events sell out, users join the waitlist:*
- **Position Tracking**: *Queue position for fair processing*
- **Priority Score**: *Algorithm-based prioritization*
- **Expiration**: *Automatic cleanup of stale entries*
- **Notification Preferences**: *User communication settings*
- **Unique Constraint**: *One waitlist entry per user per event*

*Automated processing promotes waitlisted users when cancellations occur."*

### **5. NOTIFICATIONS TABLE (Communication Hub)**
*"Multi-channel notification system:*
- **Type Enum**: *Email, SMS, push, in-app notifications*
- **Message Content**: *Templated communication*
- **Delivery Channels**: *JSON array for multiple delivery methods*
- **Status Tracking**: *Sent, delivered, read states*
- **Timestamps**: *Full delivery audit trail*

*Supports real-time user engagement and critical booking updates."*

### **üîó RELATIONSHIP DETAILS**

#### **1. Users ‚Üî Bookings (1:N)**
*"One user can have multiple bookings, but each booking belongs to exactly one user. This enables user booking history and loyalty tracking."*

#### **2. Events ‚Üî Bookings (1:N)**
*"One event can have multiple bookings until capacity is reached. This relationship drives our capacity management and revenue tracking."*

#### **3. Users ‚Üî Events (M:N via Bookings)**
*"The many-to-many relationship between users and events is implemented through the bookings table, allowing rich transaction data."*

#### **4. Waitlist Relationships**
*"Both users and events connect to waitlists, enabling overflow management when events reach capacity."*

#### **5. Admin Event Creation**
*"Admin users can create and manage events through the created_by foreign key relationship."*

---

### **üéØ KEY DESIGN DECISIONS**

#### **Concurrency Control:**
*"Version columns in critical tables prevent race conditions during high-traffic scenarios like Taylor Swift ticket releases."*

#### **Data Integrity:**
*"Check constraints, foreign keys, and unique constraints ensure data consistency at the database level."*

#### **Performance Optimization:**
*"Strategic indexes on date, status, and foreign key columns provide sub-millisecond query performance."*

#### **Scalability:**
*"UUID primary keys and sharding support enable horizontal scaling to millions of users."*

#### **Business Logic Enforcement:**
*"Database triggers and functions handle automatic field generation and complex business rules."*
