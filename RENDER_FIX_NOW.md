# ðŸš¨ URGENT FIX NEEDED

Your Render deployment is failing because it's missing TypeScript compilation!

## Quick Fix - Update Build Command:

1. **Go to your Render Dashboard**
2. **Click on your web service** (evently-booking-system)
3. **Go to Settings tab**
4. **Scroll down to "Build & Deploy" section**
5. **Change the Build Command from:**
   ```
   npm install
   ```
   **To:**
   ```
   npm install && npm run build
   ```
6. **Click "Save Changes"**
7. **Trigger a new deploy** (it should automatically redeploy)

## Why This Fix Works:
- Your app is written in TypeScript (.ts files)
- Render needs to compile them to JavaScript (.js files) 
- The `npm run build` command runs `tsc` (TypeScript compiler)
- This creates the `dist/server.js` file that your start command needs

## Current Error:
```
Error: Cannot find module '/opt/render/project/src/dist/server.js'
```

## After Fix:
âœ… TypeScript will compile to `dist/server.js`
âœ… Your app will start successfully
âœ… You'll get a working live URL

**This should take less than 1 minute to fix!**

Once you make this change, the deployment should succeed and your app will be live.
