## üèóÔ∏è **1. SYSTEM OVERVIEW (First 2 Minutes)**

### üéØ **Elevator Pitch**
*"I built a high-concurrency event booking system that handles ticket sales with zero overselling. The system uses a three-layer concurrency protection strategy, processes 130+ requests per second, and maintains 99.97% booking success rate. It's built with TypeScript, PostgreSQL with 4-shard architecture, Redis caching, and includes production features like real-time notifications, email integration, and comprehensive monitoring."*

### üìä **Key Metrics to Highlight**
```typescript
const impressiveMetrics = {
    // Performance
    responseTime: "15ms average",
    cacheHitRatio: "99.26%",
    bookingSuccessRate: "99.97%",
    
    // Scale
    concurrentUsers: "130+ RPS tested",
    databaseShards: "4-shard PostgreSQL",
    typeScriptFiles: "51 files",
    
    // Features
    emailTemplates: "6 production templates",
    realTimeNotifications: "Multi-channel delivery",
    zeroOverselling: "Three-layer concurrency protection"
};
```

## üî• **2. TECHNICAL DEEP DIVE TOPICS**

### üö® **A. Concurrency Control (HIGH-IMPACT TOPIC)**

**Question**: *"How do you prevent race conditions in high-traffic booking scenarios?"*

**Your Answer**: 
```typescript
// Three-layer protection strategy
"I implemented three layers of concurrency protection:

Layer 1: Redis distributed locks prevent same user double-booking
const lockKey = `booking_lock:${user_id}:${event_id}`;
await redis.set(lockKey, timestamp, 'PX', 30000, 'NX');

Layer 2: PostgreSQL row locks prevent race conditions
SELECT * FROM events WHERE id = $1 FOR UPDATE;

Layer 3: Optimistic locking prevents lost updates
UPDATE events SET version = version + 1 WHERE version = $expected;

This achieves 99.97% booking success with zero overselling incidents."
```

**Follow-up Topics**:
- Distributed locking strategies
- Deadlock prevention
- Performance vs consistency tradeoffs

---

### üóÑÔ∏è **B. Database Architecture (CRITICAL TOPIC)**

**Question**: *"Why PostgreSQL over MongoDB for this use case?"*

**Your Answer**:
```sql
-- ACID transactions critical for financial integrity
BEGIN;
    INSERT INTO bookings (...);
    UPDATE events SET available_seats = available_seats - $1;
COMMIT;

-- Complex analytics queries
SELECT e.name, COUNT(b.id) as bookings, 
       AVG(b.total_amount) as revenue
FROM events e
LEFT JOIN bookings b ON e.id = b.event_id
GROUP BY e.id;
```

*"PostgreSQL provides ACID guarantees essential for booking systems. I can't afford eventual consistency when handling payments. Plus, the complex JOIN queries for analytics are native to SQL."*

**Scaling Strategy**:
- 4-shard horizontal partitioning
- Read replicas for analytics
- Connection pooling optimization

---

### ‚ö° **C. Caching Architecture (PERFORMANCE TOPIC)**

**Question**: *"Explain your caching strategy and invalidation"*

**Your Answer**:
```typescript
// Three-tier caching hierarchy
L1: In-memory (75% hit rate, 30-300s TTL)
L2: Redis distributed (88% hit rate, 5min-1hr TTL)  
L3: Database query cache (1hr-1day TTL)

// Smart invalidation on booking
await eventCache.invalidateEvent(event_id);  // L1
await redis.del(`event:${event_id}`);        // L2
// L3 expires naturally

// Result: 99.26% overall cache hit ratio
```

**Key Points**:
- Cache-aside pattern
- Write-through vs write-behind tradeoffs
- Cache coherence in distributed systems

---

### üìß **D. Email System Integration (INTEGRATION TOPIC)**

**Question**: *"How did you integrate email notifications?"*

**Your Answer**:
```typescript
// Multi-provider strategy with graceful degradation
class EmailService {
    // SendGrid API (production) + SMTP (development)
    private useSendGridAPI = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production';
    
    async sendBookingConfirmation(data: BookingData) {
        try {
            return await this.sendViaSendGrid(data);
        } catch (error) {
            // Graceful degradation - booking succeeds even if email fails
            await this.queueForRetry(data);
        }
    }
}

// Non-blocking integration
const booking = await bookingService.create(request);
emailService.sendConfirmation(booking).catch(err => 
    console.error('Email failed but booking succeeded')
);
```

**Architecture Benefits**:
- Non-blocking design
- Multiple provider support
- Beautiful HTML templates
- Retry mechanisms

## üé§ **3. SYSTEM DESIGN QUESTIONS**

### üåç **Scaling to 1M Users**

**Question**: *"How would you scale this system to handle 1 million concurrent users?"*

**Your Structured Answer**:

**Phase 1: Horizontal Scaling**
- Load balancer with 10+ API instances
- Database read replicas (3-5 replicas)
- Redis cluster for distributed caching

**Phase 2: Microservices**
```typescript
const microservices = {
    userService: 'Authentication + user management',
    bookingService: 'Ticket booking + payment processing', 
    eventService: 'Event management + capacity tracking',
    notificationService: 'Email + push + SMS + WebSocket',
    analyticsService: 'Reporting + metrics + dashboards'
};
```

**Phase 3: Event-Driven Architecture**
- Message queues (RabbitMQ/Kafka)
- Event sourcing for audit trails
- CQRS for read/write separation

**Phase 4: Global Distribution**
- CDN for static assets
- Multi-region deployment
- Database sharding across regions

---

### üö® **Handling Viral Events (10K Simultaneous Bookings)**

**Question**: *"A popular artist announces a surprise show. How do you handle 10K people trying to book simultaneously?"*

**Your Answer**:

**Traffic Management**:
```typescript
// Implement virtual queue
class VirtualQueue {
    async joinQueue(userId: string, eventId: string): Promise<QueuePosition> {
        const position = await redis.lpush(`queue:${eventId}`, userId);
        const estimatedWait = position * 30; // 30 seconds per person
        
        return { position, estimatedWait };
    }
    
    async processQueue(eventId: string): Promise<void> {
        // Process queue members one by one
        const userId = await redis.rpop(`queue:${eventId}`);
        if (userId) {
            await this.allowBooking(userId, eventId, 300); // 5-minute window
        }
    }
}
```

**Capacity Protection**:
- Rate limiting: 5 booking attempts per user per minute
- Queue system with estimated wait times
- Circuit breakers for database protection
- Auto-scaling triggers

**User Experience**:
- Real-time queue position updates
- Estimated wait time display
- Automatic refresh when user's turn arrives

## üß† **4. PROBLEM-SOLVING SCENARIOS**

### üîß **Debugging Production Issues**

**Scenario**: *"Database queries are suddenly slow. How do you diagnose and fix?"*

**Your Systematic Approach**:

**Step 1: Immediate Diagnostics**
```sql
-- Check for long-running queries
SELECT pid, now() - pg_stat_activity.query_start AS duration, query 
FROM pg_stat_activity 
WHERE (now() - pg_stat_activity.query_start) > interval '5 minutes';

-- Check for locks
SELECT blocked_locks.pid, blocked_activity.usename, blocked_activity.query
FROM pg_catalog.pg_locks blocked_locks
JOIN pg_catalog.pg_stat_activity blocked_activity ON blocked_activity.pid = blocked_locks.pid;
```

**Step 2: Performance Analysis**
```sql
-- Analyze query performance
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS) 
SELECT * FROM events WHERE event_date > NOW() ORDER BY event_date;

-- Check index usage
SELECT schemaname, tablename, attname, n_distinct, correlation 
FROM pg_stats 
WHERE tablename = 'events';
```

**Step 3: Resolution Strategy**
- Add missing indexes for new query patterns
- Optimize existing queries with better WHERE clauses
- Implement connection pooling tuning
- Scale with read replicas if needed

---

### üí∏ **Financial Consistency**

**Scenario**: *"A user reports being charged but no booking exists. How do you handle this?"*

**Your Answer**:
```typescript
// Audit trail investigation
const auditInvestigation = async (userId: string, timestamp: Date) => {
    // Check all related tables
    const bookingAttempts = await pool.query(`
        SELECT * FROM booking_attempts 
        WHERE user_id = $1 AND attempted_at BETWEEN $2 AND $3
    `, [userId, timestamp - 5*60*1000, timestamp + 5*60*1000]);
    
    const paymentLogs = await pool.query(`
        SELECT * FROM payment_logs 
        WHERE user_id = $1 AND created_at BETWEEN $2 AND $3
    `, [userId, timestamp - 5*60*1000, timestamp + 5*60*1000]);
    
    const transactionLogs = await pool.query(`
        SELECT * FROM audit_log 
        WHERE user_id = $1 AND created_at BETWEEN $2 AND $3
    `, [userId, timestamp - 5*60*1000, timestamp + 5*60*1000]);
    
    return { bookingAttempts, paymentLogs, transactionLogs };
};

// Resolution process
1. Immediate: Trace all transactions with correlation IDs
2. Investigation: Review payment gateway logs
3. Resolution: Either complete booking or process refund
4. Prevention: Improve transaction monitoring
```

---

## üéØ **5. TECHNOLOGY JUSTIFICATION**

### üü¢ **TypeScript vs JavaScript**

**Question**: *"Why TypeScript for this project?"*

**Your Answer**:
```typescript
// Type safety prevents runtime errors
interface BookingRequest {
    user_id: string;     // UUID validation at compile time
    event_id: string;    // Prevents parameter mix-ups  
    quantity: number;    // Ensures numeric operations
}

// Catches errors before deployment
function bookTickets(request: BookingRequest): Promise<Booking> {
    // TypeScript ensures all required fields exist
    // Intellisense improves developer productivity
    // Refactoring is safer with type checking
}
```

**Benefits**:
- 80% reduction in runtime errors
- Better team collaboration with interfaces
- Improved maintainability for 51 TypeScript files
- Enterprise readiness

---

### üóÑÔ∏è **PostgreSQL vs MongoDB**

**Question**: *"When would you consider MongoDB instead?"*

**Your Answer**:

**PostgreSQL Wins For**:
- ACID transactions (booking integrity)
- Complex queries with JOINs
- Strong consistency requirements
- Relational data models

**MongoDB Better For**:
- Rapid prototyping with changing schemas
- Horizontal scaling out-of-the-box
- Document-heavy workloads
- Real-time analytics with aggregation pipelines

*"For a booking system handling money, PostgreSQL's ACID guarantees and mature transaction handling make it the clear choice."*
