# üìß EMAIL SETUP GUIDE FOR RENDER

## ‚ö†Ô∏è PROBLEM: Gmail SMTP Blocked on Render Free Tier

Render's free tier **blocks outbound SMTP connections** (ports 587, 465, 25). This causes connection timeouts when trying to send emails via Gmail.

---

## ‚úÖ SOLUTION: Use SendGrid (FREE)

SendGrid offers:
- ‚úÖ **100 emails/day FREE** (perfect for testing/demo)
- ‚úÖ **Works on Render free tier**
- ‚úÖ **Reliable delivery**
- ‚úÖ **Easy setup**

---

## üöÄ SETUP STEPS:

### **Step 1: Create SendGrid Account**

1. Go to: https://signup.sendgrid.com/
2. Sign up with your email
3. Verify your email address
4. Complete the onboarding (choose "Web API")

### **Step 2: Create API Key**

1. Go to: https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys
2. Click **"Create API Key"**
3. Name it: `Evently-Production`
4. Select **"Full Access"**
5. Click **"Create & View"**
6. **COPY THE KEY** (you'll only see it once!)
   - Format: `SG.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy`

### **Step 3: Verify Sender Email**

1. Go to: https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/sender_auth/senders
2. Click **"Create New Sender"**
3. Fill in:
   - **From Name:** Evently
   - **From Email:** nutalapatisrikrishna85@gmail.com

   - **Company Address:** (any address)

### **Step 4: Add to Render Environment**

Go to Render Dashboard ‚Üí evently-app ‚Üí Environment ‚Üí Add these variables:

**OPTION A: Using SendGrid (RECOMMENDED FOR RENDER)**

```bash
# Remove old Gmail variables and add these:
SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG.your-actual-api-key-here
SMTP_FROM=Evently <nutalapatisrikrishna85@gmail.com>
```

**OPTION B: Keep Gmail for Local Development**

Your local `.env` already has Gmail configured - it will work locally!

```bash
# Local .env (already configured)
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_SECURE=false
SMTP_USER=nutalapatisrikrishna85@gmail.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=srbygwoehwbeinov
SMTP_FROM=Evently <noreply@evently.com>
```

---

## üéØ FINAL CONFIGURATION

### **For Render (Production):**

Add to Render Environment Variables:
```
SENDGRID_API_KEY = SG.your-actual-sendgrid-api-key
SMTP_FROM = Evently <nutalapatisrikrishna85@gmail.com>
```

### **For Local Development:**

Keep your `.env` file as is - Gmail will work locally!

---

## üìß TESTING

After deployment, test by:

1. **Register a new user** ‚Üí Should receive welcome email
2. **Create a booking** ‚Üí Should receive confirmation email
3. **Cancel booking** ‚Üí Should receive cancellation email
4. **Join waitlist** ‚Üí Should receive waitlist email

Check SendGrid Dashboard to see email activity:
https://app.sendgrid.com/email_activity

---

## üîç TROUBLESHOOTING

### **Emails not sending?**

Check Render logs for:
```bash
‚úÖ EmailService initialized with SendGrid configuration
```

### **"Sender not verified" error?**

Go to SendGrid ‚Üí Sender Authentication and verify your email address.

### **Still using Gmail variables?**

Remove these from Render:
- SMTP_HOST
- SMTP_PORT
- SMTP_SECURE
- SMTP_USER
- SMTP_PASSWORD

Only keep:
- SENDGRID_API_KEY
- SMTP_FROM

**SendGrid Free Tier:**
- 100 emails/day

## üé§ FOR YOUR INTERVIEW

You can say:

> "I implemented a flexible email system that supports both Gmail SMTP (for local development) and SendGrid (for production). SendGrid was chosen for production because it works reliably on Render's free tier, whereas direct SMTP connections are blocked. The system gracefully degrades - if email isn't configured, it logs the action without failing the core functionality like booking or registration."

**This shows:**
- ‚úÖ Production-ready thinking
- ‚úÖ Understanding of cloud platform limitations
- ‚úÖ Flexible architecture
- ‚úÖ Graceful degradation

---

## ‚ú® ALTERNATIVE: Just Log Emails (No Setup Required)

If you don't want to set up SendGrid for the interview, the system already handles this gracefully:

- Emails are logged to console
- Core functionality (booking, registration) still works
- No errors thrown

To see what emails would be sent:
- Check Render logs after actions
- Look for: `üìß Email sent successfully` or `üìß Email not configured`

This is actually **perfectly acceptable for a demo/interview!**
