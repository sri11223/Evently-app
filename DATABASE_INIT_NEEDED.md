## ⚠️ Missing Step: Database Tables

Your app is live but the **database tables haven't been created yet**.

### 🔧 Quick Fix - Initialize Database:

We need to run the SQL schema to create the tables. You have two options:

#### Option 1: Using Render PostgreSQL Dashboard
1. Go to your **Render Dashboard**
2. Click on your **PostgreSQL database** (evently-postgres-database)
3. Click **"Connect"** → **"External Connection"**
4. Use the connection string to run SQL commands

#### Option 2: Create Database Init Endpoint (Recommended)
I can create a special endpoint that initializes all tables automatically.

### 🗃️ Tables Needed:
```sql
- users (for authentication)
- events (for event management)  
- bookings (for booking system)
- waitlist (for waitlist management)
```

## What to do next?
Let me know which option you prefer:

1. **"Create init endpoint"** - I'll add an endpoint that creates all tables automatically
2. **"Use database dashboard"** - I'll guide you through manual SQL execution

Once tables are created, all endpoints will work perfectly! 🚀
